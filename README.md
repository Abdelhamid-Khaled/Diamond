# Diamond
In this machine learning project, we will use a dataset containing various attributes of diamonds, such as carat, cut, color, and width, to build a model that can predict the price of diamonds. The project is based on supervised learning, which means that we will be using a labeled dataset, where the correct output (i.e., the diamond price) is provided for each example in the dataset.
To build the model, we will be using a linear statistical model, which is a type of model that makes predictions based on the linear relationship between the input features and the output. This means that the model will try to fit a line (or a plane, in higher dimensions) to the data, and use this line to make predictions about the diamond prices.
After building the model, we will proceed to check the assumptions of linear regression. These assumptions are necessary for the model to be valid, and they include assumptions about the linearity of the relationship between the input and output, the homoscedasticity of the errors (i.e., the constant variance of the errors), and the normality of the errors.n conclusion, the comparison between the linear regression model and the neural network model shows that the neural network model is more accurate in predicting the outcome of the diamonds prices, as it achieved a higher R2 score of 0.9403680770506707 compared to the linear regression model which achieved a R2 score of 0.8878187588744918 This suggests that the neural network model was able to capture more complex relationships and patterns in the data, leading to a better prediction of the diamond prices. However, it's worth noting that the neural network model may be more computationally expensive and require more data to train, and it may be less interpretable than a linear regression model, which makes it easier to understand the relationship between the input variables and the output.

Finally, we will use the model to make predictions on new, unseen data, and check the accuracy of these predictions. This will allow us to determine how well the model is able to generalize to new data, and whether it is a good fit for the problem at hand.
